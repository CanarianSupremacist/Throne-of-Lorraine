EVTDESC712340;With our rise to glory and our succesfull campaign in north Africa we should now go either east or west;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru1.t;A Last Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru1.d;The holy land languishes under the Turkish Yoke. Fellow Christians from Beirut to Jaffa are under the Sultans Jackboot. But no more! With Europe stronger than ever, now is our opportunity to set the score with the Turk once and for all! We shall demand the Sultan to surrender all territories of the Holy land immediately, and if not, we shall call for the last crusade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru2.t;A Last Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru2.d;An emissary from the pope has come, demanding all territories along the Levantine coast be surrendered immediately. If we do not acquiesce, they threaten to call a crusade. Is this a legitimate threat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru3.t;The Turks agree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru3.d;Unbelievable news! The Sultan has agreed! This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru4.t;Call for the Last Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru4.d;The Turks have, as expected, laughed away our demands. But we could be the last ones laughing. Do we call for the crusade, your holiness, or shall we call this mistake away?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru5.t;A Last Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru5.d;Strange news comes from Rome: The Pope has called for a new crusade! While this may be just more rambling from an institution on the death knell, humiliating the Turks is an appetizing goal. But is prestige worth that much to send our men overseas?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru6.t;European invasion of the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru6.d;The Europeans are beating back the Turks! While stabbing fellow Muslims may be a dishonest move, the seizure of the Holy cities is a prize we cannot pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru7.t;Wonderful news from Rome: ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru7.d;A Last Crusade! The Pope has called for a new crusade! Finally, our mission is within grasp again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru8.t;Defeat in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru8.d;Disaster! With weak support from fellow Christians, The Ottomans rallying their nation with a call for Jihad, and military failures, we have been beaten from the Holy land again. Now, where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru10.t;Defeat in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru10.d;Disaster! With weak support from the Empire, The Pope rallying fellow Europeans, and military failures, we have been beaten from the Holy land. Now, where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru11.t;Victory in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru11.d;Praise God! We have seized Jerusalem! As Papal soldiers march into Jerusalem, fellow Christians rejoice in happiness!  This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru12.t;Victory in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru12.d;Praise God! We have beaten back the Crusaders! The prestige of the Empire has been strengthened, and the Sultan is more respected than ever!  This is a glorious day for all Muslims!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru13.t;Victory in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru13.d;Praise God! We have seized Jerusalem! The prestige of the Papal state has been strengthened, and the Pope is more popular than ever!  This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU1.T;Guangseo seizes Guangdong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU1.D;Upon the death of our governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, our dysfunctional court has been struggling to decide on a candidate for the next governor-general. Seizing this opportunity, It seems that the king of Guangseo has appointed his choice for governor, under the pretext of giving his advice. Though infuriating that our subordinate would just nominate a loyalist to him, his choice seems to be popular with the people. The court has bickered the opportunity for intervention away.;;;;;;;;;;;; ;
FEU2.T;Guangseo is now under our control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU2.D;Upon the death of the governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, we have managed to secure our candidate for the new governor-general! As according to the secret deal, he is now under our control and will tie Guangdong to Guangseo even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU3.T;Bokgun Seizes Gangseo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU3.D;The maritime province of Bokgun has traditionaly produced great merchant families, and the king of Bokgun has used them to his benefit. Today, it is revealed that their influence stretches further than expected. The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed new ministers for the province without even informing us, apparently under the advice of the merchant clique. It seems that yet another province has escaped our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU4.T;Gangseo buckles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU4.D;The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed all of our demands!This is a glorious day, and our influence grows even further!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU5.T;Un-Gui seizes Seongdo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU5.D;The unthinkable has happened. Troops from Un-Gui have just seized the capital Seongdo of Sichuan from us! Our administration seems to have fled without even a fight, and it seems like the peasants are joining the rebels. This is the most brazen attack on our authority in decades, and we need something to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU6.T;Guizhou has been captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU6.D;Our troops have seized Guiyang. The plan went better than expected, and the local farmers are greeting us as liberators. However, this move will have consequences. Consequences that we have been preparing for years. Now we strike, for the liberation of China!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU7.T;War with the Feudatories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU7.D;"The Feudatories have been growing since their establishment, and it seems that they think they can finally strike against the Tiger. And we will teach them a lesson that they shall never forget. Those three ""kings"" shall be hanged in a few weeks!";;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.T;Our claims on Xikang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east. This is a great opportunity to assert our claims on Xikang, and finally unite all Tibetans under our rightful rule! We must be quick and assert our control on the entire region; Then, the weak Buyeo would realize that dislodging us from Xikang would be more trouble than leaving us. Onwards to Kham!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU9.T;Our claims on Dehong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU9.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east, and our loyal Kachin subjects have petitioned us to unite their people and take Dehong for ourselves! As benevolent rulers, we must of course answer their call. The rich Jade from the nearby regions is, of course, a welcome addition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU10.T;The second Trung Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU10.D;Disaster! As soon as our troops have left for the northern frontlines, rebels demanding Dai nam independence are attacking our garrison left and right! This is a grave danger to our kingdom, and actions need to be taken immediately. Or else, we could lose it all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU11.T;All contacts to Formosa have been lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU11.D;Grave news from Formosa: The tribal aborigines have sacked the provincial capital of Kaohsiung City. Our administration has been decapitated, and our merchants have hurridly escaped to the mainland. We need to restore order immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU12.T;The pacification of the south;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU12.D;The three rebelling Feudatories have been reconqueared, and their kings have been executed. The Chinese now fear us once more, and their rebellious spirit has been beaten down. All rumours of the empire declining have been silenced, and the future looks brighter than ever. A truly glorious day for the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU13.T;Victories from the frontlines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU13.D;As the empire's dogs flee north, we have secured all lands south of the Yangtse. Their emissaries carry the news of surrender, and we will force our demands upon them. Now, our reign is secure, free from the heedings of the false Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU14.T;Final victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU14.D;Today, the guns are silent. The empire retreats north of the Yangtse, and a prominent commander has been agreed upon to administer the lands of Chu as a buffer state between the free kingdoms. This is a glorious day for the Chinese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU15.T;An Unbelievable defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU15.D;What went wrong? How could have this happened? We have completely lost to our formal vassals, and all lands south of the Yangtse has been lost. Can we rule over our uppity subjects any longer? Can we even claim the title of the Emperor of China? We need answers now, and we need them quick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ1.T;A raid on Akmolinsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ1.D;All reports from the Akmolinsk krai indicate the Kazakhs have launched a raid against our colonists. Buildings have been damaged, and the empire's prestige is tarnished. We shall ride to Kazakhstan to subdue the rowdy hordes once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ2.T;The porous border with Bukkhara;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ2.D;After the annexation of the Juz, we thought our troubles with the hordes were over. It wasn't. Gangs, smugglers, and criminals cross over the porous border with Bukkhara, and our citizens are suffering. We will march to Bishkek and let the Khan learn the lesson for such crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME51390;Start a civil war;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT23908OPTA;Yes, we shall be allies with the Aztecs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT23908OPTB;We should just stay on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood0.t;Demands from the metropolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood0.d;We have traditionaly tried to convert our Ruthenians to the one true Catholic faith. No more, it seems. A letter from the Metropolitan of Kiev demands that freedom for his flock be allowed, or else. While the demands are harsh, if Russia intervenes with this, it could get worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood1.t;Metropolitan of Kiev requests military aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood1.d;The Metropolitan of Kiev has sent us requests of military aid, offering us the loyalty of the Ruthenians if we can free them from the Lithuanians. How can we refuse such offers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood2.t;Triumph over the Lithuanians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood2.d;With our troops marching into Lithuania, the Grand duke has sent us offers of peace. Now, we can assert our dominion over the Ruthenians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood3.t;The Loss of the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood3.d;The unthinkable has happened. Most of Ruthenia has been lost, and our troops are decimated. We may have only one option left: the Polish. But are we that desparate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood4.t;Offers from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood4.d;After their defeat from the Ruthenian rebels, the Lithuanians have come to us for protection. They suggest a union between us two, and promise loyalty and prosperity. A hundred wars couldn't have acheived today's offers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood5.t;Victory over Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood5.d;Victory! The Tsar's armies have been defeated, and now we own Kiev once more. The metropolitan has been exiled, and a new loyal one has been elected. Now, peace may finaly be achieved again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood6.t;Defeat in the Dneiper;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood6.d;The Dneiper runs red with Russian blood. Our foolish attempts over the Ruthenians have devastated our armies. Can we recover from this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood8.t;Loss of connection to South Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood8.d;As Russia marches east, our hold of Ruthenia weakens day by day. And today, we may have completely lost it. As Russia has cleaved our nation in half, the Southern Ruthenian portion of our lands have declared independence! As we have lost all means to deal with the rebellion, it seems that our only option is to watch. How much longer can we even remain as an independent nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99800;Hausa Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99800;The predominatly Hausa regions of our realm rebelled against Songhai rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Crimeaw0.t;The Crimean Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw0.d;If there is any nation that has been the greates existential threat to Russia, it is the Crimean Khanate. Until we teached them a lesson they will never forget at the battle of Kinburn, They devastated Russian and Lithuanian Ruthenia. Now, as fortifications at the Azov near completion, we have a unique opportunity for us to drive in the final nail in the Crimean coffin. The question is, do we ally with the Lithuanians for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw1.t;The Russian offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw1.d;The Russians have come to us with a secret offer; They offer us Odessa if we join in their coming war with Crimea. While ending the Crimean Khanate is quite the prospect, are we sure it is better with the Russians expanding at their expense?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw2.t;The Lithuanians agree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw2.d;As expected, the Lithuanians have agreed to our offers of Odessa for their army. Now, we march South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw3.t;The Lithuanians refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw3.d;The Lithuanians have refused, probably wary of our expansion. They do not know we can do without them. Now, we march South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw4.t;Victory over Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw4.d;The Turkish intervention forces retreat over the sea. Now, the Crimeans are at our mercy-and we seem to be out of it. The territories shall be incorporated into guvernorates, and the land shall be open for Russian colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw5.t;Victory over Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw5.d;The Turkish intervention forces retreat over the sea. Now, the Crimeans are at our mercy-and we seem to be out of it. The territories shall be incorporated into guvernorates, and the land shall be open for Russian colonization. Of course, The Odessan region goes to the Lithuanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw6.t;Beaten back from Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw6.d;While we haven't lost land, we spent so much blood for so little. How did we lose? Where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw0.t;The Georgian Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw0.d;Interesting news has arrived from Georgia. The Ruling prince Dmitri Bagration has been ousted, and the Mukhrani branch has taken over! Prince Bagration wants his lands back, and he has come to us with an offer. He offers us steadfast loyalty if we manage to oust Ivane Mukhrani and protect him from Turkish interference. But do we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw1.t;The Russians are in Georgia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw1.d;There has been a palace coup in Georgia, and the Russians seem like they won't let this opportunity to go to waste. They have invaded from the north, with the exiled prince at their helm. Russians marching south of the Caucusus is never a welcome prospect, but can we risk war with the Russians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw2.t;Victory in Georgia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw2.d;Our forces march through Tbilisi. The Mukhranis seek refuge in Constantinople, and our grip over Georgia is secure. Today is a glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw3.t;Defeat in Georgia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw3.d;Turkish forces march through Tbilisi. The Bagrationis seek refuge in Moscow again, and the Turkish grip over Georgia is secure. Today is a sad day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV1.t;Whom to contact?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV1.d;As we work our way into Azov, we have a decision to make;" Whom do we contact for its purchace? The City is nominally owned by the Farenikte, a collection of Jewish settlements. They are a workable folk, but will drive a hard bargain for one of their own cities. Alternatively, we could seek ""help"" from their nominal protectors, the Venetians. With their silence, we could simply demand the settlement outright. Of course, that would be a threatening act, but money is money...";;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV2.t;A demand over Azov;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV2.d;The Russians have demanded us to hand over Azov, or else! While Azov is an integral part of the nation, this might be our last chance for negotiations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV3.t;A deal over Azov;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV3.d;The Russians have secretly demanded us to hand over Azov, unknownst to the Farenikte. While Azov is an integral trading port for our nation, this might be our last chance for negotiations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV4.t;A deal over Azov;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BuyAZV4.d;Success! Our officials are heading to our newest port city, while the Venetians are assured of trading privileges. Russia can now look across the Black sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies0.t;The Disaster in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies0.d;Kyushu has been hit hard by typhoons this summer, yet the convoluted bakufu led by the old shogun seems to be just fine letting the peasants die. The Sangiin of Merchants have decided that we might have to intervene to save the peasants. While this may be technically interfering in the business of the daimyo of Hyuga no Kuni, what harm could a fleet of rice do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies1.t;The Disaster in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies1.d;A flurry of reports come from the port of Kagoshima. First, it indicated that the merchant confederation in the southerly isles of Sainantan have sent us a ship of grain to mitigate our severe typhoon season. Then, news came that the samurai bureaucrats of the port and the Sainantan merchants came to a brawl. Next, a Samurai had struck down a merchant with his rights of Kiri-sute gomen for insolence. Finally, there was a battle between the fleets sailors and the port garrison, and our garrison seem to have lost to their superior weapons? \n\n Quick dialogue between cooler heads have stopped this from leading to an acutal war, but the news has shocked the isles. How could have a mob of merchants beaten true Samurai? Do we have to take a look into their weapons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies2.t;A battle in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies2.d;The fleet sent to Kagoshima returns with shocking news. First, it indicated that the samurai bureaucrats of the port and our merchants came to a brawl. Next, a Samurai had struck down a merchant with his rights of Kiri-sute gomen for insolence. Finally, there was a battle between the fleets sailors and the port garrison, and our fleet seem to have scored a victory? \n\n Quick dialogue between cooler heads have stopped this from leading to an acutal war, but the news has shocked the isles. How did we win? Is the mainland's army that weak?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bunminkounou0.t;Daimin gokuo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou0.d;The Emperor's words have kicked off discussion after discussion in the streets. A new brand of scholars calling themselves Civil Confucians have openly talked about how the peasants, farmers, and merchants could have their delegates advise samurai. In response, more and more samurai are responding in violence to silence the upstarts. \n\n While the movement remains minor, we should keep an eye on them. Just for security. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou1.t;$PROVINCENAME$ Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou1.d;Terrible news from $PROVINCENAME$! A group of samurai have attacked public speakers carrying the banner of Bunmin kounou! While the samurai might have been right to correct those insolent scholars, they might have gone overboard. Already, the public opinion is shifting to their scholars! $PROVINCENAME$ is on the verge of a riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou2.t;A study of Sainantan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou2.d;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to study and learn from our southern colony of Sainantan of their ways of managing the economy, the society and even their politics. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the Kyogoku shogunate's power, and may serve to further incite rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;

This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the Kyogoku shogunate's power. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan must decide whether it supports the Emperor's edict or quietly opposes it;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution0.t;A modern constitution for a modern Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution0.d;After our victory over the Tokugawa, we are poised to enact a new constitution never tried before in Asia. \n\n Borrowing Heavily from nations such as Venice and the Akino league, this legislation seeks to guarentee equal rights for all peasants to be heard by the emperor. While there are simmers of reactionaries in the countryside, we have shown our military might during the war-no one would want to challenge us again. \n\n Right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution1.t;Rural areas in open revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution1.d;Terrible news from $PROVINCENAME$! The rural gentry are activly defying and even hindering our efforts of constitutional reform, calling it the Shizan kenpō(The Stillborn constitution) and seeking to replace it by return to tradition. Worse, even the peasantry supposed to support us are at best disturbed at the rapid pace of change. Time will be needed for the rural regions to be stable again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar0.t;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar0.d;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war? Are the risks of Chinese intervention reasonable?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar1.t;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar1.d;The Japanese have come to us with a demand. Apparently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects have killed Japanese sailors on Formosa, and they demand us to transfer sovereignty of the island immediatly. This will mean war if we refuse... What do we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
Taiwanwar2.t;Formosan offers;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar2.d;Formosa has been a quasai-independent state after our conquest of Fujian. The Formosans paid lip service as a province under us, and we haven't bothered to ratify their vassalige. Today, the Formosans ask us for help-apparently the Japanese seek to conquear them? They offer to be an official vassal under our emperor in exchange for military assistance. But do we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar3.t;Buyeo intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar3.d;As expected, the Buyeo have intervened in affairs between us and Formosa. They will pay for this insolence. ;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar4.t;The Treaty of Shimonoseki;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar4.d;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. The damnable Japanese are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarrassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement -- hand over Formosa and pay reparations. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them what they want, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar5.t;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar5.d;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us Formosa as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Asia remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;
