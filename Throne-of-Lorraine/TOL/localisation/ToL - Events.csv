Cru2.t;A Last Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru2.d;An emissary from the pope has come, demanding all territories along the Levantine coast be surrendered immediately. If we do not acquiesce, they threaten to call a crusade. Is this a legitimate threat?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru3.t;The Turks agree!;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru3.d;Unbelievable news! The Sultan has agreed! This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru4.t;Call for the Last Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru4.d;The Turks have, as expected, laughed away our demands. But we could be the last ones laughing. Do we call for the crusade, your holiness, or shall we call this mistake away?;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru5.t;A Last Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru5.d;Strange news comes from Rome: The Pope has called for a new crusade! While this may be just more rambling from an institution on the death knell, humiliating the Turks is an appetizing goal. But is prestige worth that much to send our men overseas?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru6.t;European invasion of the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;

FEU1.T;Guangseo seizes Guangdong!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU1.D;Upon the death of our governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, our dysfunctional court has been struggling to decide on a candidate for the next governor-general. Seizing this opportunity, It seems that the king of Guangseo has appointed his choice for governor, under the pretext of giving his advice. Though infuriating that our subordinate would just nominate a loyalist to him, his choice seems to be popular with the people. The court has bickered the opportunity for intervention away.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Today, it is revealed that their influence stretches further than expected.

It seems that yet another province has escaped our control.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU4.T;Gangseo buckles!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU4.D;The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed all of our demands!This is a glorious day, and our influence grows even further!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU5.T;Un-Gui seizes Sacheon!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU5.D;The unthinkable has happened. Troops from Un-Gui have just seized the capital Chongqing of Sacheon from us! Our administration seems to have fled without even a fight, and it seems like the peasants are joining the rebels. This is the most brazen attack on our authority in decades, and we need something to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU6.T;Chongqing has been captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU6.D;Our troops have seized Chongqing. The plan went better than expected, and the local farmers are greeting us as liberators. However, this move will have consequences. Consequences that we have been preparing for years. Now we strike, for the liberation of China!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU7.T;War with the Feudatories!;;;;;;;;;;;;

FEU8.T;Our claims on Xikang;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east. This is a great opportunity to assert our claims on Xikang, and finally unite all Tibetans under our rightful rule! We must be quick and assert our control on the entire region; Then, the weak Buyeo would realize that dislodging us from Xikang would be more trouble than leaving us. Onwards to Kham!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU9.T;Our claims on Dehong;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU9.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east, and our loyal Kachin subjects have petitioned us to unite their people and take Dehong for ourselves! As benevolent rulers, we must of course answer their call. The rich Jade from the nearby regions is, of course, a welcome addition.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU10.T;The second Trung Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU10.D;Disaster! As soon as our troops have left for the northern frontlines, rebels demanding Dai nam independence are attacking our garrison left and right! This is a grave danger to our kingdom, and actions need to be taken immediately. Or else, we could lose it all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;

RUSKAZ2.T;The porous border with Bukkhara;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ2.D;After the annexation of the Juz, we thought our troubles with the hordes were over. It wasn't.
