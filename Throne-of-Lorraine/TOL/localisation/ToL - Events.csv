FEU1.T;Guangseo seizes Guangdong!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU1.D;Upon the death of our governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, our dysfunctional court has been struggling to decide on a candidate for the next governor-general. Seizing this opportunity, It seems that the king of Guangseo has appointed his choice for governor, under the pretext of giving his advice. Though infuriating that our subordinate would just nominate a loyalist to him, his choice seems to be popular with the people. The court has bickered the opportunity for intervention away.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU2.T;Guangseo is now under our control;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU2.D;Upon the death of the governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, we have managed to secure our candidate for the new governor-general! As according to the secret deal, he is now under our control and will tie Guangdong to Guangseo even further.;;;;;;;;;;
FEU3.T;Bokgun Seizes Gangseo!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU3.D;The maritime province of Bokgun has traditionaly produced great merchant families, and the king of Bokgun has used them to his benefit. Today, it is revealed that their influence stretches further than expected. The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed new ministers for the province without even informing us, apparently under the advice of the merchant clique. It seems that yet another province has escaped our control.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU4.T;Gangseo buckles!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU4.D;The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed all of our demands!This is a glorious day, and our influence grows even further!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU5.T;Un-Gui seizes Sacheon!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU5.D;The unthinkable has happened. Troops from Un-Gui have just seized the capital Chongqing of Sacheon from us! Our administration seems to have fled without even a fight, and it seems like the peasants are joining the rebels. This is the most brazen attack on our authority in decades, and we need something to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU6.T;Chongqing has been captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU6.D;Our troops have seized Chongqing. The plan went better than expected, and the local farmers are greeting us as liberators. However, this move will have consequences. Consequences that we have been preparing for years. Now we strike, for the liberation of China!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU7.T;War with the Feudatories!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU7.D;The Feudatories have been growing since their establishment, and it seems that they think they can finally strike against the Tiger. And we will teach them a lesson that they shall never forget. Those three "kings" shall be hanged in a few weeks!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU8.T;Our claims on Xikang;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east. This is a great opportunity to assert our claims on Xikang, and finally unite all Tibetans under our rightful rule! We must be quick and assert our control on the entire region; Then, the weak Buyeo would realize that dislodging us from Xikang would be more trouble than leaving us. Onwards to Kham!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU8.T;Our claims on Dehong;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east, and our loyal Kachin subjects have petitioned us to unite their people and take Dehong for ourselves! As benevolent rulers, we must of course answer their call. The rich Jade from the nearby regions is, of course, a welcome addition.;;;;;;;;;;;;
