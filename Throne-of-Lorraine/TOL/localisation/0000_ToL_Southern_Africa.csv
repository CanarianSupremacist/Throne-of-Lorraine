xhosaprophet6_desc;The wedding had been planned for months.

EVTDESC49517;The death of Fanomezantsoa, the chief of Arbota, made his fragile chiefdom descend in a spiral of chaos as his sons, Mzila and Mawewe, fight for the throne. Soshangane's armies, that once overran the Portuguese settlements at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sena, now turn their gaze inwards as the chiefdom slowly edges towards civil war. It goes without saying that this represents an optimal opportunity to take some of these lands back, and several individuals in the colonies already began to take advantage of this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Rharhabe, the current ruling faction, who have put the chief's favoured wife, the queen regent, in power. The Gcaleka, the main opposition to the Rulers. They claim that the Rharhabe have been too soft on the foreigners, and that the Rharhabe are too weak to bring Xhosa to greatness. The Ndlambe.
