EVTDESC49517;The death of Fanomezantsoa, the chief of Arbota, made his fragile chiefdom descend in a spiral of chaos as his sons, Mzila and Mawewe, fight for the throne. Soshangane's armies, that once overran the Portuguese settlements at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sena, now turn their gaze inwards as the chiefdom slowly edges towards civil war. It goes without saying that this represents an optimal opportunity to take some of these lands back, and several individuals in the colonies already began to take advantage of this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
