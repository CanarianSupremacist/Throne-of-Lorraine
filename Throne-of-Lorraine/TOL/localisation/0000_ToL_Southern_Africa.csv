xhosaprophet6_desc;The wedding had been planned for months.

EVTDESC49517;The death of Fanomezantsoa, the chief of Arbota, made his fragile chiefdom descend in a spiral of chaos as his sons, Mzila and Mawewe, fight for the throne. Soshangane's armies, that once overran the Portuguese settlements at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sena, now turn their gaze inwards as the chiefdom slowly edges towards civil war. It goes without saying that this represents an optimal opportunity to take some of these lands back, and several individuals in the colonies already began to take advantage of this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Rharhabe, the current ruling faction, who have put the chief's favoured wife, the queen regent, in power. The Gcaleka, the main opposition to the Rulers. They claim that the Rharhabe have been too soft on the foreigners, and that the Rharhabe are too weak to bring Xhosa to greatness. The Ndlambe.

SHO_start_title;An Empire of Empty Promises;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHO_start_desc;The Second Vatsonga Empire, as it has been called, has little to do with the Tsonga of old, which are all but extinct and assimilated into the modern Tsonga population. The empire has been built in less than a decade, not because of its impressive military, great leadership, or strong economy. It was built by the desperation of its people, being surrounded on all sides by powerful enemies, with no unity, being fed lies by an ambitious clan who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But now, the empire of empty promises is facing the consequences of its actions. It has no proper systems to gain wealth from its people, no methods of dealing with the new waves of bantus, no ways of dealing with foreign powers meddling with its politics, and no ways of paying its leaders their fair due. We must act fast if Tsonga is to survive, or we will simply be a distant memory of a worse time.;;;;;;;;;;;;
