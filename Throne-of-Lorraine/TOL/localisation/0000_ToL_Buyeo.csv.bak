reign_of_the_yongping_emperor_desc;Ascending to the throne in 1860 at the age of 18, the young Yongping Emperor was significantly influenced by his tutors, many of which originated from the Silhak school of thought in late-Buyeo Korea. A staunch supporter of modernization across the Buyeo Empire, his ascension marks the beginning of a new age of modernity in our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
modernize_the_northern_armies_title;Modernize the Northern Armies;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
modernize_the_northern_armies_desc;Our recent confrontations with the Russians have shown our armies are in need of modernization to combat future attacks. By using new western firearms and hiring western trained officers, we might do better in future confrontations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_jiangnan_ports_title;Renovate the Jiangnan Ports;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_jiangnan_ports_desc;Since the days of the Tang and Song, the Yangtze Delta has been a key node of the maritime Silk Road. However, our failure to keep up with developments in harbor technology has allowed foreign ports like Macau to take over this profitable trade. If we are to regain control of our foreign commerce, we must renovate the ports of Hangzhou and Suzhou to be able to compete with the ports of the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
use_our_jesuit_contacts_title;Use our Jesuit Contacts;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
use_our_jesuit_contacts_desc;The Jesuit Order has long been active in our country as missionaries and advisors since they were recognized by Emperor Sukjong in the late 17th century. We should consider using these foreigners to end our isolationism from the outside world by making contact with their headquarters in the far Eastern land of Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
chinese_jesuit_education_title;Support Jesuit Education?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
chinese_jesuit_education_desc;Despite our long tradition of Confucian examinations, much of our empire remains illiterate which has made modernization difficult. We could use the educational expertise of our new friends in Colombia to establish missions across China to further the education of the poor. This however may alienate those in our population who remain suspicious of the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
new_korean_army_title;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
new_korean_army_desc;As Russia continues to encroach the Northern borders of our homeland in Manchuria and Korea, there is a need to strengthen our armies in the region to prevent future incursions. An eccentric Korean general called Yi Seongmin is proposing a sweeping set of army reforms aimed at modernizing our army and bringing it up to par with the foreigners. Taking these reforms will greatly improve our ability to defend our empire but at the cost of angering conservatives in the army and bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
expanding_the_coal_mines_title;Expand the Shanxi Coal Mines;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
expanding_the_coal_mines_desc;Following the 1876 North China Famine and the devastation wrought by the Nian Bandits, the once prosperous province of Shanxi lies in ruins. As our empire’s demand for coal and other minerals reaches new heights with our modernization, the governor of Shanxi has suggested an ambitious redevelopment program to use foreign technology to reopen Shanxi’s greatly reduced mines. This he says will not only provide enough coal for our modernization but also help restore Shanxi to its former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
shanxi_railways_title;Establish the Datong Railway;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
shanxi_railways_desc;As Shanxi’s reconstruction continues to progress, there is an increased need for more efficient transportation to move settlers, grain and coal in and out of the mountains. The governor has suggested the development of a rail network connecting the mountains to Beijing via the passes East of the northern city of Datong. While the governor’s plan is ambitious, the new railway would speed up Shanxi’s redevelopment and would prevent a future bottleneck of supplies at the Guguan pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
china_merchants_shipping_title;Establish the China Merchants Steamship Corporation;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
china_merchants_shipping_desc;As part of our modernization process, it is imperative we regain control over our coastal trade which has become dominated by foreign steamships which have proven faster and more reliable than our junks. The governor of Zhejiang has proposed establishing our own native owned steamship corporation to compete with the foreign ships. This would allow us to not only regain control of our internal commerce, but also enable economic expansion elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
centralization_edicts_title;The Centralization Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
centralization_edicts_desc;The devastation of the 1887 floods has clearly shown the flaws in our administration. Our lack of oversight over the provinces and the antiquated Half-Half system allowed corrupt officials to ignore their duties resulting in millions of deaths along the Yellow River. We must implement a series of administrative reforms to put an end to the Half-Half system and place the provinces under more direct control to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
yongping_taxation_reforms_title;Yongping’s Taxation Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
yongping_taxation_reforms_desc;Since the Three Feudatories War, our empire has been undergoing a fiscal crisis as we expend enormous sums of money to repair the damage the war has inflicted on Southern China. Some officials have proposed a sweeping series of land and taxation reforms aimed at consolidating the complex set of levies into a singular annual payment and buying arable land to plant grain to feed the poor. While these reforms may put an end to the financial crisis, they are likely to prove unpopular amongst landowners and the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

EVTNAME651888;A Divided Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651888;Ever since the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, China has been ripe for conquest and invasion. From the Mongols hordes that brought down the Song to the Tibetan, Uighur and Yi raids that left Daguang ripe for the Balhae conquest, the people of China have constantly found themselves at war with hostile and powerful invaders. Such raids have left their mark on the people of China, encouraging the rise of strong provincial leaders that could better protect the peasants against foes from all sides while draining the strength of central authority. As the world enters a new age of innovation and new threats emerge, will the people of China be able to band together against the rising storm or will the Middle Kingdom be torn apart for the wolves of a new age?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651887;The Lack of New World Crops;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651887;In the Throne of Lorraine timeline, European colonization of the Columbias (the Americas) was significantly less successful. Without a strong European presence in the Pacific Coast of the Columbias, no Trans-Pacific silver trade developed to bring New World crops to China by sea while the spread of crops by land via the Silk Road and Yunnan was limited as a weakened Chinese presence in the peripheries resulted in more instability and reduced trade. Coupled with the loss of population in the Early Modern era to wars against foreign invaders like the Tibetans or Uighurs, China's population is much lower than in OTL.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651889;Southern Devastation;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651889;Our war against the Three Feudatories has resulted in significant destruction across South China. Towns from Fujian to Sichuan lay burned while refugees roam the countryside, occasionally robbing passers-by to obtain money for food. As the costs of rebuilding  mount, it is clear our government is heading towards a full budgetary crisis. While the conflict may has ended, its scars will continue to show for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651890;The Hakka Punti Clan War;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651890;Of the provinces left devastated by the Three Feudatories War, Guangdong was amongst the worst affected, having suffered the depredations of both the Guangseo and Buyeo armies. In the impoverished landscape of flooded riverbanks and looted villages, long simmering tensions between the native Yue and immigrant Hakka populations came roaring back to life as competition for resources intensified. In the Taishan area west of Canton, the Siap Yue have begun attacking Hakka villages and the Hakka are beginning to respond in kind. We can choose to send armies to intervene and seperate the parties before too much blood is spilt, or do nothing at the cost if increased casualties. What shall we do? ;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651902;The Reorganization of Southern China;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651902;As part of our reconstruction of Southern China, it is imperative that we must reintegrate the feudatory lands in a manner so that they can never threaten our rule over China. Fujian will be put under Zhejiang's supervision while Yun-Gui and Guangseo will be incorporated into the new provinces of Guizhou and Liangguang and placed under more direct control. Hopefully these measures will be enough to prevent future rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;
